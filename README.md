Kotlin XML Builder
=

This library can be used to build xml documents from Kotlin code.
It is based on the HTML builder described in the [Kotlin docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html)

It is designed to be lightweight and fast. There isn't any validation except to 
escape text to not violate xml standards.

Usage
=
To use in Gradle, simply add the jcenter repository and then add the following dependency.
```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile("org.redundent:kotlin-xml-builder:[VERSION]")
}
```

Similarly in Maven:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jcenter</id>
        <url>https://jcenter.bintray.com</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>

... 

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.redundent</groupId>
        <artifactId>kotlin-xml-builder</artifactId>
        <version>[VERSION]</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Example
=
```kotlin
val people = xml("people") {
    xmlns = "http://example.com/people"
    "person" {
        attribute("id", 1)
        "firstName" {
            -"John"
        }
        "lastName" {
            -"Doe"
        }
        "phone" {
            -"555-555-5555"
        }
    }
}

val asString = people.toString()
```
produces
```xml
<people xmlns="http://example.com/people">
    <person id="1">
        <firstName>
            John
        </firstName>
        <lastName>
            Doe
        </lastName>
        <phone>
            555-555-5555
        </phone>
    </person>
</people>
```

```kotlin
class Person(val id: Long, val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val phone: String)

val listOfPeople = listOf(
    Person(1, "John", "Doe", "555-555-5555"),
    Person(2, "Jane", "Doe", "555-555-6666")
)

val people = xml("people") {
    xmlns = "http://example.com/people"
    for (person in listOfPeople) {
        "person" {
            attribute("id", person.id)
            "firstName" {
                -person.firstName
            }
            "lastName" {
                -person.lastName
            }
            "phone" {
                -person.phone
            }
        }
    }    
}

val asString = people.toString()
```
produces
```xml
<people xmlns="http://example.com/people">
    <person id="1">
        <firstName>
            John
        </firstName>
        <lastName
            >Doe
        </lastName>
        <phone>
            555-555-5555
        </phone>
    </person>
    <person id="2">
        <firstName>
            Jane
        </firstName>
        <lastName>
            Doe
        </lastName>
        <phone>
            555-555-6666
        </phone>
    </person>
</people>
```
### Processing Instructions
You can add processing instructions to any element by using the `processingInstruction` method.

```kotlin
xml("root") {
    processingInstruction("instruction")
}
```

```xml
<root>
    <?instruction?>
</root>
```

#### Global Instructions
Similarly you can add a global (top-level) instruction by call `globalProcessingInstruction` on the
root node. This method only applies to the root. If it is called on any other element, it will be ignored.


```kotlin
xml("root") {
    globalProcessingInstruction("xml-stylesheet", "type" to "text/xsl", "href" to "style.xsl")
}
```

```xml
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="style.xsl"?>
<root/>
```

## Print Options
You can now control how your xml will look when rendered by passing the new PrintOptions class as an argument to `toString`.

`pretty` - This is the default and will produce the xml you see above.

`singleLineTextElements` - This will render single text element nodes on a single line if `pretty` is true
```xml
<root>
    <element>value</element>
</root>
```
as opposed to:
```xml
<root>
    <element>
        value
    </element>
</root>
```
`useSelfClosingTags` - Use `<element/>` instead of `<element></element>` for empty tags

`useCharacterReference` - Use character references instead of escaped characters. i.e. `&#39;` instead of `&apos;`

## Reading XML
You can also read xml documents using the `parse` methods. They provide basic 
xml parsing and will build a `Node` element to build upon.

For more advanced consuming, check out [konsume-xml](https://gitlab.com/mvysny/konsume-xml).
It includes many more features for consuming documents.

Release Notes
=============
Version 1.7.2
-
* Fixing issue where a text element that contains an empty string doesn't respect `useSelfClosingTags`.\
Thanks to [@d-wojciechowski](https://github.com/d-wojciechowski) for finding this!

Version 1.7.1
-
* Added new PrintOptions to control the indent character(s) used. `indent` default is `\t`.\
Thanks to [@vRallev](https://github.com/vRallev) for adding this!

Version 1.7
-
**POTENTIAL BREAKING CHANGES**
* All node types override `equals` and `hashCode`. This could change the behavior of putting nodes in a Set or Map.\
Thanks to [@cbartolome](https://github.com/cbartolome) for requesting this!

Version 1.6.1
-
* Added new PrintOptions to use character references instead of HTML names.\
Thanks to [@senecal-jjs](https://github.com/senecal-jjs) and [@sleddog](https://github.com/sleddor) for
adding this!

Version 1.6.0
-
* Updated README

**BREAKING CHANGES**
* The `kotlin-reflect` dependency has been removed from the transitive dependnecies.
This module is only used for controlling element order using `@XmlType`.
If your project depends on that feature, you will need to have `kotlin-reflect` on the 
runtime classpath.\
Thanks to [@mvysny](https://github.com/mvysny) for requesting this!

Version 1.5.4
-
* Adding new global processing instructions.\
Thanks to [@rjaros](https://github.com/rjaros) for requsting this!

Version 1.5.3
-
* Fixing single line text element rendering for processing instructures and CData elements.\
Thanks to [@jonathan-yan](https://github.com/jonathan-yan) for fixing this!

Version 1.5.2
-
* Added ability to specify the xml version. This affects both the prolog and text escaping.\
Thanks to [@ZR8C](https://github.com/ZR8C) for finding this!

Version 1.5.1
-
* Added ability to add processing instructions. Use the new `processingInstruction` method to do this.\
Thanks to [@endofhome](https://github.com/endofhome) for adding this!
* Added ability to add comments. Use the new `comment` method to do this.\
Thanks to [@ejektaflex](https://github.com/ejektaflex) for requesting this!

Version 1.5.0
-
* Added more robust PrintOptions class to allow for more control over how xml is structured.\
Fixes issue #16

Thanks to [@pkulak](https://github.com/pkulak) for finding and fixing this!

**BREAKING CHANGES**
* Changed Element.render method signature to use kotlin.text.Appenable instead of kotlin.text.StringBuilder.
Any custom element types created will need to be updated

Version 1.4.5
-
* Fixed incorrect handling of CDATA elements. `prettyFormat` should not alter the CDATA content.
* Fixed nested CData elements\
Big thanks to [@TWiStErRob](https://github.com/TWiStErRob) for finding and fixing both of these!

Version 1.4.4
-
* Switched to Kotlin's `Charsets` instead of using `java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets`. `StandardCharsets` is not available in some versions of Android.\
Thanks to [@little-fish](https://github.com/little-fish) for submitting and fixing this!

Version 1.4.3
-
**BREAKING CHANGES**
* Moved `prettyFormat` to a parameter of `toString()`. `prettyFormat` in the constructor or util method is no longer available. Fixes issue #7

Version 1.4.2
-
* Fixes issue #6

Version 1.4.1
-
* Upgrading Gradle to 4.9
* Upgrading Kotlin to 1.2.60

Version 1.4
-
**BREAKING CHANGES**
* `org.redundent.kotlin.xml.Node.name` has been renamed to `org.redundent.kotlin.xml.Node.nodeName` to avoid clashes with attributes called `name`.
---
* Adding DSL generator project to generate kotlin-xml-builder DSL from a schema file.
See [kotlin-xml-dsl-generator](./kotlin-xml-dsl-generator) for details

Version 1.3
-
* Added ability to parse an xml document into a builder object using the new `parse` method.
* Upgrading Gradle and Kotlin versions.

Version 1.2
-
* Added a `sitemap` method to allow for easy generation of sitemaps (which is what this project was created for in the first place).
* Added `String.invoke` for elements allowing you to specify elements by just their name (see docs above)
* Added some searching methods to search child nodes. `filter`, `first`, `firstOrNull`, and `exists`.
* Added some mutation methods to allow you to add/remove/replace nodes in an element. 

Version 1.1
-
* Added convenience method for elements with just a name and value. `element("name", "value")`
* Removed `ns` method. Please use `namespace(...)` instead.
* Upgraded Gradle version
